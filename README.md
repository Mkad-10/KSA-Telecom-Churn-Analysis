# KSA Telecom Customer Churn Prediction & Market Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Saudi telecom industry and building a machine learning model to predict customer churn.
It combines **open-source churn datasets** with **Saudi market indicators** (from CST, Meqyas, OpenCelliD, and telecom operators’ reports) to provide both descriptive insights and predictive modeling.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. **Predict customer churn** using machine learning techniques (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
2. **Integrate Saudi-specific market context** such as QoE (Quality of Experience), tower density, and internet usage indicators into the model.
3. **Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify key churn drivers (contract type, monthly charges, QoE, etc.).
4. **Visualize insights** through interactive dashboards (Google Looker Studio + Plotly).
5. **Showcase a full ML pipeline** from data collection to modeling and visualization.

## 📊 Data Sources
- **Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)** – Base customer-level dataset for training ML models.
- **Saudi Telecom Market Reports (CST)** – Internet penetration, data consumption, QoE indicators.
- **Meqyas Reports** – Quality of experience measurements (download/upload speeds, content access).
- **OpenCelliD** – Open source cellular tower locations and density.
- **STC, Mobily, Zain Annual Reports** – Market share, infrastructure, and growth indicators.

## 🏗️ Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Integration** – Combine Kaggle dataset with Saudi market/contextual data.
2. **Preprocessing** – Cleaning, encoding, scaling, and feature engineering.
3. **EDA** – Statistical and visual analysis to understand churn patterns.
4. **Modeling** – Train classification models and evaluate with ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1.
5. **Visualization** – Develop interactive dashboards for market insights and churn predictions.
6. **Reporting** – Publish findings and methodology in a structured report (GitHub + LinkedIn).

## 🚀 Expected Outcomes
- A predictive model with improved accuracy by integrating Saudi-specific features.
- Insights into customer churn drivers in the telecom industry.
- Interactive dashboards showcasing QoE, market trends, and churn predictions.
- A comprehensive GitHub project to demonstrate skills in **Data Analytics, ML, and Telecom domain knowledge**.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project uses **publicly available and open-source datasets** (Kaggle, OpenCelliD, CST reports).
No personal or confidential customer data from Saudi telecom companies is used.
All results are for educational and research purposes only.
